    <h1>Pointers</h1>

    <p>A <em>pointer</em> in c++ is a variable that stores the address of another variable.  An <em>address</em> is a number that represents a particular location in memory (RAM).</p>
    <p>When a pointer variable is created, the type of the pointer indicates the type of data stored at the memory location pointed to by the pointer.  For example:</p>

    <pre><code class="language-cpp">int* x;</code></pre>

    <p>declares a variable that can hold a pointer to an integer.  Note that in this example, the value (address) of the pointer is not specified, which is generally a bad idea.  The best practice is to always
        initialize variables as soon as you create them.</p>
    <p>It is important to remember that the <em>value</em> of a pointer is an address.  The variable <em>x</em> declared above does <em>not</em> store an integer, it stores the address of an integer.</p>
