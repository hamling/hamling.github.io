    <h1>References</h1>

    <p>A <em>Reference</em> in c++ is a variable that refers to another variable.  A reference does not have its own value, 
        but instead is simply an alias or another name for some other variable.  For example:</p> 

    <pre><code class="language-cpp">
        int x{20}; // create a variable x and initialize its value to 20
        int& r{x}; // create a variable r that is a reference to x

        r = 3;  // sets x to 3  
    </code></pre>

    <p>The code above creates a reference r that is an alias for x.  Using (reading or modifying) r is no different than using x.   
       So, assigning a value to r will cause x to be changed, since both x and r refer to the same object (the same chunk of memory).
    </p>

    <p>Consider the following statements:</p>

    <pre><code class="language-cpp">
        int y{15};

        r = y;   // sets x to 15 (the value of y). 
    </code></pre>

    <p>Note: The code above does <em>not</em> make r a reference to y!  After you create a reference, you cannot change what variable it refers to.</p>
