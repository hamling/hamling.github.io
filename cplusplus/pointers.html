    <h1>Pointers</h1>

    <p>A <em>pointer</em> in c++ is a variable that stores the address of another variable.  An <em>address</em> is a number that represents a particular location in memory (RAM).</p>
    <p>When a pointer variable is created, the type of the pointer indicates the type of data stored at the memory location pointed to by the pointer.  For example:</p>

    <pre><code class="language-cpp">int* x;</code></pre>

    <p>declares a variable that can hold a pointer to an integer.  Note that in this example, the value (address) of the pointer is not specified, which is generally a bad idea.  The best practice is to always
        initialize variables as soon as you create them.  Here's a somewhat longer example:</p>

    <pre><code class="language-cpp">
        int num{13};    // declare an integer variable named <em>num</em> and initialize it with the value 13
        int* x{nullptr};  // declare a pointer to an integer.  Note: a pointer that isn't pointing at a particular address should be set to nullptr

        x = &num;   // in this statement, & is the "address of" operator.  x now points at <em>num</em>.

        cout << *x << endl; // prints 13   the * is the dereference operator

        *x = 50;   // sets <em>num</em> to 50

        cout << num << endl; // prints 50
    </code></pre>


    <p>It is important to remember that the <em>value</em> of a pointer is an address.  
        The variable <em>x</em> declared above does <em>not</em> store an integer, it stores the <em>address</em> of an integer.</p>
